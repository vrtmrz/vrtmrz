## Hello everyone!

I am Vorotamoroz, a believer in progress and harmony for mankind. (You know, this is the theme of EXPO '70).
May the world be improved with all our hands!

Some of the non-trivial information and release notice will be posted in [Nostr](https://njump.compile-error.net/npub1a79dtp6wzpp9kj4fynzyc40rqwm7h3gaf4m9yzluu5krzu0vpllqkstec2).

I have posted in [Mozilla.social](https://mozilla.social/@vrtmrz) for a while. However, Mozilla.social will be at the sunset in a while. Maybe Nostr is more decentralised, and my posts will remain.

I am posting some miscellaneous, with updates plugins or something! If you want to reach me, please feel free to send mentions or replies! (Bear in mind that my English is quite poor. But perhaps a conversation between us will improve it (with your patience). [X (former Twitter)](https://x.com/vorotamoroz) is also useful but not decentralised.

Japanese daily posts are posted in this [Another Nostr Account](https://njump.compile-error.net/npub1azzj0dzw8evwtgyjeucyfz5cs8k0eg7rd0x4qvggcg3s7lx0dmaqv9sfka).

## And, I am back on the track!

After months of bewilderment and confusion, I am mostly back to the days of happiness (Even if there is still the matter of clearing out the mansion, which is in a terrible state of disrepair)! I apologise for being very careless and prone to making mistakes in recent months. I would love to say thank you all again, and express my appreciation! For the sake of progress and harmony for mankind, I will keep this condition! 

Totally, I realised that the confidence of "I am sane" is not reliable without any scale of the others if once lost sanity, again.
