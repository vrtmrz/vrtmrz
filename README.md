## Hello everyone!

I am Vorotamoroz, a believer in progress and harmony for mankind. (You know, this is the theme of EXPO '70).
May the world be improved with all our hands!

## Excuses
Regrettably, I must inform you that our beloved mother has passed away. I trust that this sentiment will resonate: I have not lost my passion nor my resolve. 

I shall uphold our obligations with the utmost gratitude and respect and return shortly.
